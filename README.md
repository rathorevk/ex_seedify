# Backend code exercise

Create a Phoenix application and implement features to seed data and send email.

## What will we build

A phoenix app with 2 endpoints to manage users.

## Requirements

- We should store users and salaries in PostgreSQL database.
- Each user has a name and can have multiple salaries.
- Each salary should have a currency.
- Every field defined above should be required.
- One user should at most have 1 salary active at a given time.
- All endpoints should return JSON.
- A readme file with instructions on how to run the app.

### Seeding the database

- `mix ecto.setup` should create database tables, and seed the database with 20k users, for each user it should create 2 salaries with random amounts/currencies.
- The status of each salary should also be random, allowing for users without any active salary and for users with just 1 active salary.
- Must use 4 or more different currencies. Eg: USD, EUR, JPY and GBP.
- Users’ name can be random or populated from the result of calling list_names/0 defined in the ExSeedify module.

### Tasks

1. 📄 Implement an endpoint to provide a list of users and their salaries
    - Each user should return their `name` and active `salary`.
    - Some users might have been offboarded (offboarding functionality should be considered out of the scope) so it’s possible that all salaries that belong to a user are inactive. In those cases, the endpoint is supposed to return the salary that was active most recently.
    - This endpoint should support filtering by partial user name and order by user name.
    - Endpoint: `GET /users`

2. 📬 Implement an endpoint that sends an email to all users with active salaries
    - The action of sending the email must use any external API and mock it.
    - ⚠️ This library doesn’t actually send any email so you don’t necessarily need internet access to work on your challenge.
    - Endpoint: `POST /invite-users`

## How to run the existing application

You will need the following installed:

- Elixir >= 1.14
- Postgres >= 14.5

Check out the `.tool-versions` file for a concrete version combination we ran the application with. Using [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) you could install their plugins and them via `asdf install`.

### To start your Phoenix server

- Run `mix setup` to install, setup dependencies and setup the database
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
